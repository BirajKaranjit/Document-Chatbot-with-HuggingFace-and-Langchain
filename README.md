**ðŸ“„ Document Chatbot with Hugging Face and Langchain**
Document Chatbot is a web application designed to help users interact with documents and get AI-powered answers to their queries.
It supports multiple file formats, including PDF, DOCX, TXT, and images, and allows users to request calls for further assistance.

This chatbot leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance response accuracy. It retrieves relevant information from uploaded documents using FAISS and Sentence-Transformers embeddings before generating answers with the Mistral-7B-Instruct model from Hugging Face.
